# Decision Tree Fraud Detection System

A C implementation of a decision tree algorithm for detecting anomalous transactions in financial data.

## Features
- Entropy-based splitting criterion
- Recursive tree construction
- Binary classification (Normal/Anomaly)
- Interactive prediction interface

## How it works
The algorithm learns from transaction amounts and their labels to build a tree that can classify new transactions as potentially fraudulent or normal.
